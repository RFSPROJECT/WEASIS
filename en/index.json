	"content": "This page describes how installing Weasis to be the default web viewer of dcm4chee web interface. See How to launch Weasis from any environments to integrate Weasis into your own user interface.\nWeasis is launched from the dcm4chee administrative web interface with the weasis protocol, as shown in the pictures below. The documentation where Weasis was launched with Java Webstart is still available here.\n For dcm4chee-arc-light For a simpler and faster installation without server components, please follow these instructions; no need to consider the following points on this page. Otherwise if you need more advanced configurations then follow these steps:\n  Install dcm4chee, if not already done (Installation with Docker is straightforward).\n  Go here and download these following files: Download issue: Some browsers (like Internet Explorer) may rename war files to zip. If so, use the Save As option when downloading and change the name back to war.\n  From weasis-pacs-connector folder:  [weasis-pacs-connector.war] Requires at least the version 7.1.2   From the folder with the latest version number (Optional if you want to run only the native version installed on the client system):  [weasis.war] requires at least Weasis 3.5.3 [weasis-i18n.war] Optional for internationalization [weasis-ext.war] Optional package for additional plug-ins (e.g. exporting the images to build an ISO image for CD/DVD)   From the folder with the latest version number:    Open the wildfly management console (at http://\u0026lt;your-host\u0026gt;:9990).\n Select the “Deployments” tab Add the .war files using the “Add” button (Choose Upload a new deployment or select Replace when the file already exists) Alternatively one may deploy .war files using JBoss Command Line Interface Console.\n     Configure weasis-pacs-connector (This step is optional if you just want to keep the default configuration).\nThe default configuration is stored in two files inside weasis-pacs-connector.war. To override the default configuration:\n Download the current weasis-pacs-connector.properties and dicom-dcm4chee-arc.properties (configuration of the dcm4chee archive) Edit the configuration as needed. For example, dcm4chee may be running on a different computer than Weasis, or the AE Title of dcm4chee may have been changed. If so, edit weasis-pacs-connector.properties or dicom-dcm4chee-arc.properties (Change pacs.host, pacs.port, and pacs.aet). Copy weasis-pacs-connector.properties and dicom-dcm4chee-arc.properties into $WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration (where $WILDFLY_HOME is the path of the running Wildfly).\nWith the docker installation use the docker copy command ($ docker cp \u0026hellip;) Instead of copying the files into $WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration, JBoss Command Line Interface Console can be used to override files in the war. Add the two configuration files with the deployment-overlay command:\n deployment-overlay add --name=dcm4chee-arc --deployments=weasis-pacs-connector.war --content=WEB-INF/classes/weasis-pacs-connector.properties=/tmp/weasis-pacs-connector.properties,WEB-INF/classes/dicom-dcm4chee-arc.properties=/tmp/dicom-dcm4chee-arc.properties --redeploy-affected For applying the new configuration, from the management console \u0026ldquo;Disable\u0026rdquo; weasis-pacs-connector.war and then \u0026ldquo;Enable\u0026rdquo;    To activate Weasis in the dcm4chee-arc-light user interface (see the matrix of the required versions in the table below): you need to add attributes by either editing docker-compose.env (from 5.22.0) or from the left menu Configuration \u0026gt; Devices \u0026gt; dcm4chee-arc \u0026gt; Extensions \u0026gt; Edit extension \u0026gt; Child Objects \u0026gt; Web Applications \u0026gt; DCM4CHEE (add \u0026amp;cdb to the URL if weasis.war has not been deployed on the server-side):\n Configure the URL for having a view button for the patient or study level.

	"content": "How to launch Weasis from any environments Here we present how to launch Weasis with associated images from any context either using weasis-pacs-connector or by building your own connector. The launch of the application is based on the weasis protocol available since version 3.5. However, it is still possible to use weasis 3.5 with Java Webstart (but only with Java 8 to 10), see the old documentation.\nUsing weasis-pacs-connector allows a high degree of integration and facilitates connection to a PACS. Here are some of the advantages:\n Automatically build a manifest according to a configuration with a PACS The initial URL starts with HTTP and is then redirected to weasis:// (as weasis:// is not allowed by wiki, blog…) Manages to build the manifest simultaneously with the start of Weasis The URL returns a manifest ID which can be requested only once (and must be consumed within 5 min)  However, it is possible to build your own connector for particular integrations or when a DICOMWeb service is available.\nRequires Weasis 3.5 (or superior) installed on the system with a native installer.\n Use weasis-pacs-connector For connecting to dcm4chee web interface, follow the instructions in Installing Weasis in DCM4CHEE. Otherwise, refer to the documentation of weasis-pacs-connector.\nStandard workflow when connecting Weasis to a PACS, RIS, EMR, EPR or any web interface:\nPACSLauncherDICOMQueryWeasisConfig(Configurationoftheuserpreferencesandthelauncherparameters)XMLmanifestBuilder(asynchronoustask,\u0026#160;startinstep2andreturndirectlyanURLwithanIDorder)2.manifestbuilderURL3.URLredirectionintoweasisprotocol(weasis://parameters)DownloadManager(ReadXMLmanifest)1.Request(URLwithUIDs,includeInvokeImageDisplayIHEProfile)6.GetDICOMfilesbyWADO5.GetthemanifestWeasisweasis-pacs-connectorClient(oranywebordesktopapplications)dcm4cheewebui4.Executeweasisprotocol  The schema above shows that the queries to the PACS are made at the same time as the viewer starts. This makes it possible to optimize the launch by simultaneously launching weasis and creating the manifest.\n weasis-pacs-connector services allow either to build a manifest from a PACS via DICOM C-Find or to upload the manifest by http POST.\n Build your own connector This documentation describes how to create your own connector without weasis-pacs-connector and with different DICOM archive types. The weasis protocol allows to build URIs to launch Weasis according to different configurations and allows to load DICOM files locally or remotely.\nHere are examples with XML manifests or with DICOMWeb RESTful services.\nBuild an XML manifest Use $dicom:get to load a XML manifest returned by your service. $dicom:get -w https://myservice/manifest?studyUID=2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.14391.1373576413.1508\nBuild an XML file containing the UIDs of the images which will be retrieved from Weasis. There is XLS to validate the content of xml. This output file can be either compressed in gzip or uncompressed. Here is an example: \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34; ?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;manifest xmlns=\u0026#34;http://www.weasis.org/xsd/2.5\u0026#34; xmlns:xsi=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;arcQuery additionnalParameters=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; arcId=\u0026#34;1001\u0026#34; baseUrl=\u0026#34;http://archive-weasis.rhcloud.com/archive/wado\u0026#34; requireOnlySOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Patient PatientID=\u0026#34;H13885_9M\u0026#34; PatientName=\u0026#34;TEST NON SQUARE PIXELS\u0026#34; PatientSex=\u0026#34;F\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Study AccessionNumber=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; ReferringPhysicianName=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; StudyDate=\u0026#34;20130711\u0026#34; StudyDescription=\u0026#34;TEST NON SQUARE PIXELS\u0026#34; StudyID=\u0026#34;PKD\u0026#34; StudyInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.14391.1373576413.1508\u0026#34; StudyTime=\u0026#34;170013\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Series Modality=\u0026#34;US\u0026#34; SeriesDescription=\u0026#34;NON SQUARE PIXELS: PIXEL ASPECT RATIO\u0026#34; SeriesInstanceUID=\u0026#34;1.2.40.0.13.1.1.87878503032592846377547034671833520632\u0026#34; SeriesNumber=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;107\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;1.2.40.0.13.1.1.126082073005720329436273995268222863740\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Series\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Series Modality=\u0026#34;MR\u0026#34; SeriesDescription=\u0026#34;NON SQUARE PIXELS: PIXEL SPACING\u0026#34; SeriesInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578035.1\u0026#34; SeriesNumber=\u0026#34;40001\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578035.1.0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578035.1.1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578035.1.2\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578035.1.3\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Series\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Series Modality=\u0026#34;MR\u0026#34; SeriesDescription=\u0026#34;NON SQUARE PIXELS: PIXEL SPACING\u0026#34; SeriesInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578664.2\u0026#34; SeriesNumber=\u0026#34;50001\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578664.2.0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578664.2.1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578664.2.2\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Instance InstanceNumber=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34; SOPInstanceUID=\u0026#34;2.16.756.5.5.100.397184556.7220.1373578664.2.3\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Series\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Study\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Patient\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/arcQuery\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/manifest\u0026gt; Important Parameters (except mandatory parameters defined in xsd):\n PatientBirthDate helps to identify a patient. StudyDate, StudyTime, Modality, SeriesNumber and InstanceNumber help to sort data before downloading images. SeriesDescription and StudyDescription allow to immediately display the descriptions before downloading the images.   From Weasis 2.5 it is possible to have multiple archives (allows to have several arcQuery tags) and the presentations tag which contains the image annotations.\n Build an XML manifest (no WADO server) This example requires only a WEB server. Weasis will download DICOM files by URLs.\nUse $dicom:get to load a XML manifest containing direct links Launch $dicom:get -w https://nroduit.github.io/samples/Lumbar/mf.xml\nRequired Parameters:\n DirectDownloadFile defines the URL of the DICOM file to download (the final URL is the combination of wadoURL + DirectDownloadFile) DirectDownloadThumbnail defines the URL of the JPEG file representing the series (the final URL is the combination of wadoURL + DirectDownloadThumbnail) See in the previous note above.   Download directly with DICOMWeb RESTful services This integration requires a PACS/VNA with DICOMweb™ services (QUERY/RETRIEVE) where the requests are managed directly by Weasis. Here are some of the advantages:\n Straightforward integration Do not require to install weasis-pacs-connector Allow passing token directly in headers (not in the URL)  Use $dicom:rs to load DICOM files. Here are some configurations of open source systems:\ndcm4chee-arc-light This configuration requires at least dcm4chee-arc-light 5.22.2 and Weasis 3.6.0. To activate Weasis in dcm4chee-arc-light user interface, you need to add the four following properties in the web portal from the left menu Configuration \u0026gt; Devices \u0026gt; dcm4chee-arc \u0026gt; Extensions \u0026gt; Edit extension \u0026gt; Child Objects \u0026gt; Web Applications \u0026gt; DCM4CHEE IID_PATIENT_URL=weasis://$dicom:rs --url \u0026#34;{{qidoBaseURL}}{{qidoBasePath}}\u0026#34; -r \u0026#34;patientID={{patientID}}\u0026#34; --query-ext \u0026#34;\u0026amp;includedefaults=false\u0026#34; -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}\u0026#34; IID_STUDY_URL=weasis://$dicom:rs --url \u0026#34;{{qidoBaseURL}}{{qidoBasePath}}\u0026#34; -r \u0026#34;studyUID={{studyUID}}\u0026#34; --query-ext \u0026#34;\u0026amp;includedefaults=false\u0026#34; -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}\u0026#34; IID_URL_TARGET=_self\nThe four properties can also be passed directly to the docker-compose.env file: IID_PATIENT_URL=weasis://$dicom:rs --url \u0026#34;{{qidoBaseURL}}{{qidoBasePath}}\u0026#34; -r \u0026#34;patientID={{patientID}}\u0026#34; --query-ext \u0026#34;\\\u0026amp;includedefaults=false\u0026#34; -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}\u0026#34; IID_STUDY_URL=weasis://$dicom:rs --url \u0026#34;{{qidoBaseURL}}{{qidoBasePath}}\u0026#34; -r \u0026#34;studyUID={{studyUID}}\u0026#34; --query-ext \u0026#34;\\\u0026amp;includedefaults=false\u0026#34; -H \u0026#34;Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}\u0026#34; IID_URL_TARGET=_self\nConfiguration notes:\n See configuration for versions before 5.22.2. The character \u0026lsquo;\u0026amp;\u0026rsquo; must be escaped in the Docker environment variables. The Authorization header is not required for unsecure service.

	"content": "Weasis has a modular architecture based on OSGi: the dynamic module system for Java. It uses the Apache Felix OSGi framework which is an open source implementation of the OSGi Release 4.2 specification (OSGi Certified).\nThe following schemas show the main different plug-in types (bundle in OSGi language) and their relationships. Viewer, Viewer Tool Pane, Tool Bar, Data Explorer and Codec bundles are registered dynamically by the Declarative Services (a way to push or to consume services in OSGi environment).\nFor each bundle, translation files are packaging in a separated bundle ending by “i18n” called a bundle fragment (OSGi concept) which is merged during runtime to the application. In this way, translation can be handled separately and they are automatically loaded by the application when they are available.\nSome Codec bundles also have bundle fragments. Those fragments contain native libraries (JNI wrapping). The Weasis launcher enables downloading and loading only the native binaries related to the running platform.\n"

	"content": "The web protocol allows to launch Weasis in a web context from a specific URI scheme: weasis://parameters\nRequires Weasis 3.5 (or superior) installed on the system with a native installer.\n How to use the weasis protocol  From a web page, just make a link starting with weasis:// (see below How to build an URI) Some web frameworks such as the wiki or the URL field of some browsers only support the standard protocols (http, ftp\u0026hellip;). To solve this problem, it is necessary to use a URL redirection starting with http like the one proposed in weasis-pacs-connector: http://\u0026lt;your-host\u0026gt;:8080/weasis-pacs-connector/weasis?patientID=TESTS\n  From the command line: # Windows $ start weasis://%24dicom%3Aget%20-w%20https%3A%2F%2Fnroduit.github.io%2Fsamples%2FLumbar%2Fmf.xml # Linux $ xdg-open weasis://%24dicom%3Aget%20-w%20https%3A%2F%2Fnroduit.github.io%2Fsamples%2FLumbar%2Fmf.xml # Mac OS X $ open weasis://%24dicom%3Aget%20-w%20https%3A%2F%2Fnroduit.github.io%2Fsamples%2FLumbar%2Fmf.xml  When first used in a browser, a popup appears to confirm the opening of the weasis protocol. On Windows, it is possible to make sure that this message never appears by adding a browser policy which allows the URI weasis://*\n- With IE/Edge the policy is applied by the native installer.\n- With Chrome the policy is applied by the native installer (Windows and Linux), see how to manage URLWhitelist (d).\n How to build an URI The URI scheme \u0026ldquo;weasis://\u0026rdquo; allows you to launch Weasis from the system\u0026rsquo;s URI handler while the URI path allows you to build Weasis commands.\nweasis-pacs-connector will help to build dynamically the manifest (the references of the images to be loaded) and the launch parameters (user, profile, plugins\u0026hellip;). It will also manage user preferences.\nTo build an URI (weasis://path) without weasis-pacs-connector, you must choose one or more commands, encode the commands, and add the scheme weasis:// as prefix. Here is an example of loading an image:\n Use $dicom:get to load an image from URL $dicom:get -r https://nroduit.github.io/samples/us-palette.dcm Format the URI path with a URL encoder %24dicom%3Aget%20-r%20https%3A%2F%2Fnroduit.github.io%2Fsamples%2Fus-palette.dcm Make a link by adding \u0026ldquo;weasis://\u0026rdquo; at the beginning Open the remote image  To load multiple remote images, it is recommended to use a manifest listing the references of the images to be loaded. The easiest way to dynamically build this manifest is to use weasis-pacs-connector. However, it is possible to build it differently by following the following instructions.\n Examples to load images If you use weasis-pacs-connector, please refer to Launch Weasis.\n Use $dicom:get to load a static XML manifest containing direct links (without WADO server) Launch $dicom:get -w https://nroduit.github.io/samples/Lumbar/mf.xml Use $dicom:rs to load DICOM files with DICOMWeb RESTful services (see other examples) Launch $dicom:rs --url \u0026#34;https://demo.orthanc-server.com/dicom-web\u0026#34; -r \u0026#34;patientID=5Yp0E\u0026#34; Use $dicom:get to get dynamically the XML manifest containing direct links (without WADO server) Launch $dicom:get -w \u0026#34;http://weasis-launcher-weasis.apps.us-east-2.starter.openshift-online.com/weasis-pacs-connector/manifest?studyUID=1.2.840.113619.2.98.3467.1098086125.0.69\u0026#34; Use $dicom:get to load an image from URL and remove all the previous images if Weasis is already open Launch $dicom:close --all $dicom:get -r https://nroduit.github.io/samples/us-palette.dcm Use $dicom:get to load multiple local folders and a remote image Launch $dicom:get -l \u0026#34;D:/DICOM/Overlay\u0026#34; -l \u0026#34;D:/DICOM/Shutter\u0026#34; -r https://nroduit.github.io/samples/us-palette.dcm Use $image:get to load a non DICOM image Launch $image:get -u https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/993975/59107662-6c9ed300-8939-11e9-83ee-28f2725f4ae1.jpg  Modify the launch parameters The command for modifying the configuration at launch is $weasis:config which can have different arguments:\n cdb is the Weasis web context (The URL of weasis.war). If the value is null, the weasis version installed from the native installer is used. In the weasis-pacs-connector configuration, the default value is defined by weasis.base.url. cdb-ext is the extension web context of Weasis (The URL of weasis-ext.war containing additionnal plugins). In the weasis-pacs-connector configuration, the default value is defined by weasis.ext.url. arg is an argument for the launcher. The value must start by $, like arg=\u0026quot;$dicom:close \u0026ndash;all\u0026rdquo; (Note: the value can also be directly in the base URI, outside $weasis:config). Single-valued argument but can be specified multiple times. pro is a property for the launcher containing a key and a value separate by a space. Single-valued property but can be specified multiple times. auth is the web authorization parameter wcfg is the URL the remote Weasis configuration service.  Here are some examples that modify the launcher properties without using weasis-pacs-connector:\n Configuration for launching Weasis Dicomizer Launch $weasis:config pro=\u0026#34;felix.extended.config.properties file:conf/ext-dicomizer.properties\u0026#34; pro=\u0026#34;gosh.port 17181\u0026#34; Change the user, by default is the one of the current system session.

In the image below the zoom tool is associated with the left mouse button.\nThe zoom factor can be modified from different locations:\n by dragging the cursor over the image with the configured mouse button by scrolling the mouse wheel when configured by selecting an item in the zoom dropdown button in the toolbar from the context menu: right-click on the image \u0026gt; Zoom form the slider in the image tool panel  The zoom function always zooms in/out to the center of the screen regardless of where the cursor is.\n For selecting directly the zoom action of the mouse left button, enter \u0026ldquo;z\u0026rdquo; as a shortcut.\n Real-world zoom The real-world zoom allows displaying the content of the image at the same size of the real objects.\nThe feature requires calibrating the screen where the image is displayed. From the main menu, open File \u0026gt; Preferences (Alt + P) \u0026gt; Monitors and click on \u0026ldquo;Spatial calibration\u0026rdquo;. Then enter a value that matches to the line length or the diagonal length of the screen.\nSeveral screens can be calibrated. Each one has its own spatial calibration factor.\n Magnifying lens The magnifying lens can be activated from the toggle button of the zoom toolbar (see the image below). It has several parameters accessible from the context menu.\nThis lens can be used in many situations, for instance:\n to magnify a specific area to compare two images from the same series (select Freeze image) to display a specific area without the drawings (Unselect Show Drawings) to compare different values of Window/Level (select Freeze parameters - see image below)  Using the mouse wheel on the lens changes the zoom factor. Double-clicking on the lens adjusts the zoom factor of the lens to the one of the main image.\n Parameters of the context menu:\n Synchronize to parent zoom: When this option is activated, the zoom factor of the lens is permanently adjusted to the zoom factor of the main image (meaningful when using freeze parameters). Show Drawings: Displays in the lens the visible drawings. Magnify: Allows to select a zoom magnitude. Image: Freeze parameters allows to keep the current image processing (c.f. Window/level, LUT or filter) and Freeze image allows to keep the current image and its parameters.  "

This is the application main user interface bundle. The maven artifact of this bundle must be defined in config.properties (ex. weasis.main.ui=weasis-base-ui)  See the Weasis Architecture to understand the plug-in hierarchy.\n Build plug-ins from Maven archetype  From the root directory of an archetype execute: mvn install Generate a sample project by executing the following command: mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local Select the archetype:  weasis-plugin-base-viewer-archetype (example of a toolbar and a tool for the non DICOM viewer) weasis-plugin-dicom-viewer-archetype (example of a toolbar and a tool for the DICOM viewer)    From Eclipse: File \u0026gt; New \u0026gt; Maven Project and Search for weasis archetype in catalog filter.\n Install plug-ins For weasis-portable distribution The file \u0026ldquo;/weasis/conf/ext-config.properties\u0026rdquo; must be adapted and plug-ins must be placed in the directory \u0026ldquo;/weasis/plugins\u0026rdquo;.\nExample with weasis-isowriter:\n  Add in /weasis/conf/ext-config.properties: felix.auto.start.85=${weasis.codebase.url}/plugins/weasis-isowriter-2.6.1.jar If you want to use another directory for a plugin on your computer, you should use one of the following properties:\nOn Windows: felix.auto.start.85=file:///C:/path/to/weasis-isowriter-2.6.1.jar\nOn linux: felix.auto.start.85=file:///home/Username/path/to/weasis-isowriter-2.6.1.jar\nOn macOS: felix.auto.start.85=file:///Users/Username/path/to/weasis-isowriter-2.6.1.jar\n For not modifying the current ext-config.properties create a new file and add to the launcher the following VM argument: -Dfelix.extended.config.properties=\u0026quot;file:///your_plugin_path/myplugin-config.properties\u0026quot;\n   Place the file \u0026ldquo;weasis-isowriter-2.6.1.jar\u0026rdquo; in the directory \u0026ldquo;/weasis/plugins\u0026rdquo;\n  For the WEB distribution Build a new war file containing the plug-ins and the ext-config.properties file.\n  Build \u0026ldquo;weasis-ext.war\u0026rdquo; with the following structure: weasis-ext/ ├── conf/ │ ├── ext-config.properties ├── WEB-INF/ │ ├── web.xml ├── plugin1.jar └── plugin2.jar\n  In /weasis-ext/conf/ext-config.properties, add the plug-ins references: felix.auto.start.85= \\ ${weasis.codebase.ext.url}/plugin1.jar \\ ${weasis.codebase.ext.url}/plugin2.jar Using ${weasis.codebase.ext.url} allows to keep the base URL abstract, so moving the package to another server won’t be a problem. Otherwise absolute URLs must be used. The default value of ${weasis.codebase.ext.url} is ${weasis.codebase.url}-ext.\n   weasis-ext is the default web context when launching Weasis, using another web context requires modifying the property weasis.ext.url, it can be done by:\n changing the property in jnlp template in weasis-pacs-connector configuration. weasis.ext.url=${server.base.url}/weasis-newext It is also possible to add the code base for plugins (cdb-ext) directly in the URL: http://localhost:8080/weasis-pacs-connector/viewer?patientID=9702672\u0026amp;cdb-ext=http://localhost:8080/plugins/weasis-ext\n     For debugging a specific configuration: add to the launcher the following VM argument: -Dfelix.extended.config.properties=\u0026quot;http://server:port/weasis-ext/conf/ext-config.properties\n An example that makes a package of weasis-isowriter plugin:\n Build \u0026ldquo;weasis-ext.war\u0026rdquo;: weasis-ext/ ├── conf/ │ ├── ext-config.properties ├── WEB-INF/ │ ├── web.xml └── weasis-isowriter-2.0.3.jar  Build OSGi services All the plug-in type described in the list above are OSGi services that are registered and aggregated in the GUI. Building the plug-in from the Maven archetype will configure the OSGi service automatically. For adding new OSGi services, here is the procedure:\n  Create a class implementing one of the plug-in types and add at least the annotations @Component and @Service, for instance: ﻿@Component(immediate = false) @Service public class SamplePrefFactory implements PreferencesPageFactory { ﻿... } For more information about annotations see the Apache Felix SCR Annotations.\n   Add in pom.xml of the plug-in the maven-scr-plugin (to generate XML file from the Java annotations) and the property for loading any XML file in maven-bundle-plugin: ﻿\u0026lt;build\u0026gt; \u0026lt;plugins\u0026gt; \u0026lt;plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.apache.felix\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;maven-scr-plugin\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.apache.felix\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;maven-bundle-plugin\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/plugin\u0026gt; ...\n  "

Git or directly download source from github  Getting the Source To clone the repository, first install GIT and either clone using a graphical GIT client or directly from the command line using the command:\n$ git clone https://github.com/nroduit/Weasis.git The trunk is not a stable version and snapshot version is not retained in the cache for the web distribution (it means the files will be downloaded every time)\n Check out a tag version to build a stable version, see the tag list.\n$ git checkout \u0026lt;TAG_NAME\u0026gt; Building all Plug-ins  Go in the Weasis directory, compile and install all the plug-ins in the local Maven repository $ mvn clean install  Building Weasis Distributions The native installer will progressively replace the portable and the web distribution. It uses the weasis protocol (which not requires jar signing) instead of Java Web Start which has been removed from Java 11 release and because the end of public Oracle Java 8 updates from April 2019.\nThe documentation for building the native installer is not yet available.\n  Requires installing all the plug-ins in the local Maven repository as described in the item above. $ cd weasis-distributions $ mvn clean package -Dportable=true -P compressXZ -P compressXZ: Option for compressing the packages in xz, only from Weasis 3.6.0. The compression pack200 is not supported anymore (removed from Java 14), before 3.6.0 the profile was -P pack200.\n-Dportable=true: Option for building the portable distribution (multi-platform standalone launchers)\n For the WEB distribution using Java Webstart, it is required to sign jar files with your own certificate (by replacing values in the command below with your own values). A trust-worthy certificate from a certificate authority is required to run Java Web Start applications. A self-signed certificate generate by keytool will always display a security warning message.\n The parameters must be placed in the maven user setting or has to be the options in the Maven command: $ mvn clean package -Djarsigner.alias=\u0026#34;your_alias\u0026#34; -Djarsigner.storepass=\u0026#34;your_pwd\u0026#34; -Djarsigner.keystore=\u0026#34;your_path/keystore\u0026#34; -Dportable=true -P compressXZ    Options for building the portable distribution.\n By default, the executable on Windows runs only a single instance (from Weasis 2.0). To disable single instance in the portable version, set windowsName property empty. $ mvn clean package -Dportable=true -DwindowsName= On 64-bit system, it requires installing the 32-bit compatibility libraries to build the windows executable. On Linux, you need to install ia32-libs package. Do not place the sources in a path that contains directories with blanks or national characters, the compilation of the win32 executable can fail.\n     The distribution files are located in:\n target/web-dist/ target/portable-dist/    "

Nevertheless, for having a better Maven integration, it is possible to use IntelliJ IDEA or Netbeans by configuring weasis-launcher with similar instructions described in Debug or Run from Eclipse.\nPrerequisites  JDK 11 or higher Recent version of Eclipse IDE for Java Developers  Configure Eclipse  You can edit the VM options of the eclipse.ini file in your eclipse folder. For instance, the maximum memory for the JVM or the JVM location can be specified. Start Eclipse and select the path of the Weasis workspace It is recommended to create a new Workspace for keeping a specific Weasis configuration.\n  Go to Window \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Java \u0026gt; Installed JREs \u0026gt; Execution Environments and select the installed JDK In Window \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; General \u0026gt; Workspace  Select UTF-8 for Text file encoding Select Unix for New text file line delimiter    Code style and convention Weasis adheres to the Java Language Specification.

	"content": "The translation files are now hosted and managed on Transifex website. Get an account at Transifex and help to translate to your language! If your language is missing, just head over to Transifex and request a new language.\nText length: The translations for many languages frequently exceed the length of the corresponding English source. It could be a problem for the layout of graphical components (e.g. buttons).\n Special characters: Some characters representing values (%d, %s), newline (\\n) and HTML tags must not be translated. For other translating recommendations, see Transifex help\nFor special words or particular contexts look at the \u0026ldquo;Instructions\u0026rdquo; text box (gives explanations or definitions).\n Building Weasis-i18n weasis-i18n is the internationalization project (i18n) of Weasis. As a separate project, it can have its own release cycle. The OSGi fragments of plug-ins contain only the translation files which are merged during runtime to the matching module of the application.\nThat means the weasis-i18n.war file can be deployed at any time, it does not need to follow the Weasis life cycle. The plug-in translation will be updated by Weasis only if the timestamp number has changed. This timestamp is set during the build phase described below.\n **Additional projects to obtain a full translation of Weasis:**\nThe java-swing-dialogs translations must be updated manually in the weasis-launcher module and docking-frames translations must be packaged with the library.\n Prerequisites  JDK 8 or higher Maven 3 or higher\nIf your computer is behind a proxy server, configure maven. Git or directly download the source code from GitHub  Getting the Source To clone the repository, first install GIT and either clone using a graphical GIT client (such as Tortoise Git) or directly from the command line using the command:\n$ git clone https://github.com/nroduit/weasis-i18n.git Build the distribution Go in the weasis-i18n directory, Compile and install all the plug-ins in the local Maven repository\n$ mvn clean install -Dtransifex.credential=\u0026#34;username:password\u0026#34; All of the API calls on Transifex require the user to be authenticated. So the value \u0026ldquo;username:password\u0026rdquo; must be replaced by your credential, see how to create an account on Transifex.\nCommand if you are behind a proxy server: $ mvn clean install -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=\u0026#34;host\u0026#34; -DproxyPort=\u0026#34;port\u0026#34;; -Dtransifex.credential=\u0026#34;username:password\u0026#34;\nThe distribution files are located in the weasis-i18n-dist/target/dist folder. weasis-i18n.war must be placed in the same base context as weasis.war (if in other web context, the value of the property weasis.i18n in JNLP file must be adapted).\nTo update translation packs in weasis-portable, unzip weasis-i18n.zip and replace files in weasis-portable/weasis/bundle-i18n/.\n weasis-launcher-i18n cannot be updated dynamically as the launcher is not an OSGi module. It must be imported in the Weasis source (weasis-launcher).\n "

	"content": "Frequently Asked Questions  Why is the Weasis license Eclipse Public License? Can Weasis be incorporated in DICOM CDs or other removable media? How to enable Weasis logging? Is it possible to download DICOM files without having a WADO server?  Why is the Weasis license Eclipse Public License? The Eclipse Public License is an OSI approved license and a commercially friendly copyleft license.\nEPL is more business-friendly about some patent retaliation and reverse engineering clauses than LGPL. With EPL, derivative work (weasis plugin) can be distributed in any license type: open source, freeware, commercial\u0026hellip; However, if you distribute Weasis with some modifications (changing existing source code of the open source Weasis plug-ins), even if it is a free distribution, you are obligated to make your modifications available to others.\nFor more information about EPL, check out the EPL 2 FAQ.\nCan Weasis be incorporated in DICOM CDs or other removable media? Yes, the Weasis portable version can be copied in DICOM CD-ROMs as a multi-platform stand-alone viewer with launchers for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. The viewer requires that a Java Runtime Environment (JRE 8 or greater) be installed on the machine to run. If Java is not installed on Windows, a dialog will propose to install it from the Internet.\nThe executable (viewer-win32.exe) allows to embed a JRE in the relative directory \u0026ldquo;jre/windows\u0026rdquo; (e.g. weasis-portable/jre/windows/bin/java.exe). To support 32 and 64-bit architecture, copy 32-bit Java Runtime from its installed directory.\nNote: the embedded Java Runtime is used only when no runtime is available on the system. When Java is run from CD, it could be a little slow.\n The viewer loads automatically images from DICOMDIR or from directories configured in \u0026ldquo;weasis/conf/config.properties (by default weasis.portable.dicom.directory=dicom,DICOM,IMAGES,images).\nFor burning studies with Weasis, and additionnal plugin must be activated. In the web distribution, add weasis-ext.war. In the portable distribution, 1) uncompress weasis-ext.war, 2) copy weasis-isowriter-x.x.x.jar into weasis-portable/weasis/, 3) replace the file conf/ext-config.properties, 4) edit ext-config.properties and modify ${weasis.codebase.ext.url} by ${weasis.codebase.url}\nFor burning Weasis with dcm4chee-cdw, look at Write weasis-portable to DICOM CDs with dcm4chee-cdw.\nHow to enable Weasis logging?   From Weasis 3.5, a boot log file is always written in ${user.home}/.weasis/log/boot-x.log to trace the launching configuration. A default.log file in the same folder can trace all the Weasis activities; it must be activated:\n From File \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; General enable Rolling log, select a log level and a stacktrace limit (DEBUG and empty (unlimited stacktrace lines) are recommended for investigating problems). The default logging configuration comes from config.properties or ext-config.properties, see Weasis Preferences.    By displaying the Java console (only when launching with Java Webstart, not compatible with weasis protocol):\n Windows Linux Mac:  Navigate to the following folder: Applications \u0026gt; Utilities \u0026gt; Java. Click the Java Preferences icon and then the Advanced tab. Under the Java console section, select the Show console radio button.      Is it possible to download DICOM files without having a WADO server? Yes, but a WADO server is recommended. Downloading DICOMs can be achieved by:\n Building an XML file by using DirectDownloadFile and DirectDownloadThumbnail: Adding the following command:\n$dicom:get -r http://external.server/images/MRIX_LUMBAR/img1.dcm http://external.server/images/img2.dcm\nNote: This option must be used only for a very limited number of files.
